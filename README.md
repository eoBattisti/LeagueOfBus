# LeagueOfBus
League Of Bus is a basic CLI system developed to buy or book a bus ticket. This application was made during the Biopark Connect course in the Data Structure subject.

## The goals
Primarily the teacher give us this project to learn how to deal with pointers, saving and dealing with binary files, saving data correctly to not loose any information. 

## Chalanges
Doing this project in group was really difficult because in the beginning we had dificulties deciding how we would implement League Of Bus, brain storming ideias how 
the rules would work. After we figured out, was really nice working with Lucas and Jo√£o Gaffuri :smile:.
